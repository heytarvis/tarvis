# Tarvis

Tarvis is a full-stack library for building AI into web applications. It's primary goal is to provide simple
APIs and user interfaces for building AI apps, while remaining flexible enough to fit into many stacks and use cases. 

## Features

- **ChatGPT inspired UI**: A user interface that resembles ChatGPT, making it easy for users to interact with AI models.
- **Customizable UI**: The UI can be customized, by injecting components written in your favorite framework.
- **Node.js server client**: A server client that is tailored for the UI. Instantiate client, add API keys for your provider(s), and you're good to go.
- **Multiple providers**: Support for multiple AI providers, including Groq, Anthropic and OpenAI.
- **Persistence**: Optionally persist conversations in an IndexedDB database, allowing you to get started instantly, and add a more persistent DB later if you need it.
